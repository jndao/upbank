# Up Bank App
This project is a **work in progress** and is planned to be hosted at my website [here](http://johndao.dev/upbank).  
Originally started mid last year after the release of my favourite bank's new feature, their [api](https://developer.up.com.au/). After developing my front-end skills I've decided to transform the app from the initial version of it being a python command line app, to a react app integrated into my website.

## How to use  
If you are wanting to run this on your local machine use `npm install` to install the node modules,  and then`npm start` to run the local web server.  
Otherwise, this app is being deployed on my website and you would be able to access it there!  
To access your account details, get a copy of an up bank token [here](https://api.up.com.au/getting_started) and copy it into the prompt!  
**DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN**. If you feel as though your token has been compromised, you can regenrate it at the same link as before [here](https://api.up.com.au/getting_started).
 

## Why I made this  
After the release of Upbank's API, I have aways imagined myself creating an app where I could check and interact with my finances through my own computer and through something I created by my own.  
In combination with this, UP bank (as of 6/04/2021) has NO website and is a phone app only banking app.  
So witht these reasons, I decided to invest some of my time into creating an app of my own that I can control!  
  
## About thie project  
This project has been built with react and react-bootstrap (customised with sass) alongside the variety of packages implemented into node-modules you can find in [package.json](https://github.com/jnddao/upbank/blob/main/package.json). The majority of the app has been build in the first couple days of implementation and deployment. More features are planned to be released as I continually work on this project in my free time.  
  
## Requirements  
There are currently no system requirements for utilising the app where it is currently deployed. Only the use of the upbank token you can find [here.](https://api.up.com.au/getting_started).  
  
If you are forking this repository, there are only a few requirements:
